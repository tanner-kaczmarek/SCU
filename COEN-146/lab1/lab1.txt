Step 3: 
./Lab1_s1 caused a segmentation fault: 11

Step 4: 
The delay depends on the command line argument gave -
./Lab1_s1 500 creates parent and child process with a delay of 500 microseconds
./Lab1_s1 3000 creates parent and child process with a delay of 3000 microcseconds
./Lab1_s1 5000 creates parent and child process with a delay of 5000 microcseconds

Step5: 
./Lab1_s5 caused a segmentation fault: 11
./Lab1_s5 500 creates parent and child process with a delay of 500 microseconds
./Lab1_s5 3000 creates parent and child process with a delay of 3000 microcseconds
./Lab1_s5 5000 creates parent and child process with a delay of 5000 microcseconds
