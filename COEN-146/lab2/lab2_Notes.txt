STEP 2: 

a. Netstat: This command prints the network connections for TCP, the routing tables, and the state of all active sockets. 

b. Ifconfig: Ifconfig shows the configuration/states of your network interface. Ifconfig also can set the IP address and enable/disable the interface

c. Hostname: Hostname dispalsy the DNS hostname of the current system and can let you set hostname for the system

d. Ping: This command sends an ECHO_REQUEST to a network host with the ICMP protocol and receives an ECHO_RESPONSE from host to find how reachable a host is.  

e. Traceroute: Traceroute is a command that displays possible routes for packets using the IP protocol TTL (time to live). 

f. Telnet: Telnet allows a user to make a connection between a host and a port. 

g. Host/Dig: Both commands peform DNS lookups.  Dig can also give additonal information about the lookup. 

h. Route: This command is used to view or manipulate the network routing tables. 

i. Arp: This command displays and modifies entril in the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache/table. 

STEP 3: 

Three Hosts: 
US - wsj.com
Asia - alibaba.com
Europe (Germany) - en.avm.de 


ping -s 32 wsj.com
11 packets transmitted, 11 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 16.669/23.716/30.420/4.552 ms

ping -s 1048 wsj.com
11 packets transmitted, 11 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 16.844/29.878/35.996/5.402 ms

ping -s 32 alibaba.com
5 packets transmitted, 15 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 18.513/23.977/32.142/3.557 ms

ping -s 1048 alibaba.com
11 packets transmitted, 11 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 18.636/28.240/47.650/7.554 ms

ping -s 32 en.avm.de
11 packets transmitted, 11 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 172.202/191.155/264.559/25.641 ms

ping -s 1048 en.avm.de
11 packets transmitted, 11 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 174.323/194.677/356.589/51.285 ms

Observations: 
 - Both North America and Asia have similar packet losses for 32 and 1048, however pinging the German website had a lot longer RTT.  
 - All three regions had a jump when looking at the average RTT between the 32 bit packets compared to the 1048 bit packages (e.g. USA went from 24 to 29 ms)
        
STEP 5: 

A:
telnet gaia.cs.umass.edu 80
Trying 128.119.245.12...
Connected to gaia.cs.umass.edu.
Note: It will open the connection to the host

B:
GET /kurose_ross/interactive/index.php HTTP/1.1 
Host: gaia.cs.umass.edu
Note: It will get the HTML code of the website

C:
File Retrieved: index.php
Client Version: 1.1
Formatting of Texts and Images: CSS/HTML

STEP 6: 

telnet wsj.com 80
Trying 13.35.121.16...
Connected to wsj.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.

telnet wsj.com 3389
Trying 13.35.121.16...
telnet: connect to address 13.35.121.16: Connection timed out
Trying 13.35.121.13...
telnet: connect to address 13.35.121.13: Connection timed out
Trying 13.35.121.97...

telnet alibaba.com 80
Trying 198.11.132.198...
Connected to alibaba.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.

telnet alibaba.com 3389
Trying 198.11.132.198...
telnet: connect to address 198.11.132.198: Connection timed out
Trying 205.204.101.142...
telnet: connect to address 205.204.101.142: Connection timed out

telnet en.avm.de 80
Trying 212.42.244.122...
Connected to en.avm.de.
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.

telnet en.avm.de 3389
Trying 212.42.244.122...
telnet: connect to address 212.42.244.122: Connection timed out
Trying 2001:bf0:244:244::122...

Notes/Observations: All them were able to connect through port 80 but had trouble connecting through port 3389.  I am not sure but port 3389 may have too much traffic and therefore could not connect through that port.
