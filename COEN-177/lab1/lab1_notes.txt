#Title: Lab 1 Notes
#Description: This is a text file for lab 1 with the output of the programs and observations.


Step 1:
- In the beginning we print out basic things about the environment we are working such as the current directory path by the following command:  echo "PWD="$PWD. .
- It prints out that that there are 3 users logged in.  After doing a quick check with a who command I find out that I must be sharing servers with other people in my lab.
- I also make a folder remotely for this lab by using a mkdir command.
- It does not continue on although because at the instatement there is salagtash instead of tkaczmar.

Step 2: 
- I change $user = "salagtash" to $user = "tkaczmar" and if statement proceeds.
-Anything that is not a No exactly acts as a Yes as the while statement just makes sure its not a "No".
-Made a copy using the cp function and then listed the file to copy and destination.
-All variables have a $ in front of it when used during a print statement or other arithmetic statement. 

Step 3:
OBSERVATIONS
-Had to create a variable named pi and set equal to 3.14
-The same way we did math in step 2 does not work in step 3 as expr cannot handle decimals.
- Instead used an echo expression that prints the result to the area.
- We also "|" to bc to do floating point arithmetic. The bc function can do any type of arithmetic even outside a file in linux, so we pipe or transfer the output to the bc calculator which then we print the result to area.
