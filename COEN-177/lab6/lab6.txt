Description: Notes and step by step plan on how to set up a minix machine and communicate with it

1. We need to set up VMware so do the following commands once after each other: "setup "vmware" , "minix-get-image" , "vmware &"
2. Open up your minix 3 machine through vmware
3. In your Virtual machine now type in root for your login.  After this you should reset your password so type passwd and set it.
4. Now we are going to open up ftp so your minix virtual machine can talk to your local host. Do that with "tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &"
5. Type ifconfig to find address of VM
6. Open up terminal on local host and connect to VM using ftp <ip address>
7. CD into whatever location you want to pull from on the VM. You can change location on host machine using lcd.
8. For this assignment we cd into /usr/src/kernel
9. We then pulled main.c from VM to current location on host machine using "get main.c"
10. We can now edit the main.c however we like.
11. Now its time to put main.c with edits back onto our VM.  We did that by cd into /usr/src/kernel again and use command "put main.c"
12. Now that edited main.c is on VM minix we need to type "make world" and then type "reboot" after make world finishes.
